## Core Components

### ESP32-DEVKIT-V1
ESP32 from Espressif is our main microcontroller unit (MCU). 
This controller is easy to program and have all of features we need and more, most important is already has Wi-Fi Module.

### ZMPT101b
ZMPT101b returns output voltage to MCU.

### ACS712 30A
ACS712 is a Hall Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor that reports AC Current used by output device and reports to MCU.

### 5 Volt Relay
We use 1 channel 5v relay to control the electricity flow from AC source to output plug.

### Hi-Link HLK-5M05
HLK-5M05 is a power supply module that converts 100-240Vac to 5 Volts and 1000mA DC.

## Getting started with WPM device
- Prepare all the component needed
  - ESP32-DEVKIT-V1
  - ACS712
  - ZMPT101b
  - Hi-Link HLK-5M05
  - 5 Volt Relay
  - Male to Male jumper
  - Male to Female jumper
  - Jumper clip
- Assemble all the component as shown in Figure.1
- Connect ESP32 to your PC
- Copy and paste all code in vmonitor2.ino to the ArduinoIDE
- In the ArduinoIDE change the WiFi SSID & password to your WiFi SSID & Password
- Compile the program
- Check serial monitor to make sure everything is working correctly

## First time using WPM Website
- Go to [WPM Website](https://wpmumn.herokuapp.com/).
- Click **Don't have an account? Sign Up**
- Enter your account information
- Click **Sign Up**
- You will see a message confirming that your account is successfully created
> Berhasil mendaftar
- You can proceed to login with your email and password
- Because it's the first time you log in, you need to enter your WPM's MAC Address
- To get your device MAC Address, simply plug your ESP32 to your PC and it should be in the serial monitor
- If everthing inserted correctly, You should be able to monitor your devices now as shown in figure n.
- Next time, just log in with the account you have just made.

## How to Reverse Engineer WPM Website
- Download All file in this repo
- Run your Visual Studio Code or any other code editor
- Open 2 terminal (1 located in server path, 1 located in client path)
- Run npm install on both terminal to download all dependecies
- Change the .env in client folder and change REACT_APP_baseURL into your localhost address
- Change "proxy" in package.json in client folder into your localhost address
- Run 'nodemon server' in your server terminal to run the server
- Run 'npm start' in your client terminal to run the client
- Happy Reverse Engineering
